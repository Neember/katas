# Instruction

Write a program that returns an array from 1 to 100.
But for multiples of three return "Fizz" instead of the number and for the multiples of five return "Buzz".
For numbers which are multiples of both three and five return "FizzBuzz".

# Coding Constraint

You must do this in using TDD and only write 1 test at one time.
eg. You will write one simplest test first, write the simplest code to pass the test, refactor. Then move to the next test.

# Judging Instruction

To judge if your script is working properly, you will create a function named `fizzbuzz`.

```ruby
fizzbuzz() # => [1,2,'Fizz', ... 'Buzz']
```

# How to judge your kata?

After you have completed your kata, you can test if your kata works correctly by running
`rake judge` within your kata directory.
