# Judging Instruction

Specified instructions for the code.

For example:

To judge if your script is working properly, you will create a function
named `arabic_to_roman` which will receive a single positive integer parameter.

```ruby
arabic_to_roman(1) # => I
arabic_to_roman(2008) # => MMVIII
arabic_to_roman(47) # => XLVII
```

# How to judge your kata?

After you have completed your kata, you can test if your kata works correctly by running
`rake judge` within your kata directory.
