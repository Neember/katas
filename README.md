# README

This is a series of Ruby Katas used for practicing Ruby.

## Why do katas?

Normally a coder don't have time to practise coding or learning a new technique in coding. 
We are just buried with delivering codes in impossible date lines.
However, we do need to improve our skills in coding - either for passion in our trade or to be more productive (so that we have a closer chance to meet that impossible date line).

Katas are coding problems for you to solve. Through solving code katas, you will learn more about your art and your tools.

## Using the kata

Each kata is grouped in their own folder:

```
kata_1
  |_ instructions.md
  |_ code
    |_ kata_spec.rb
  |_ solution
    |_ kata_spec.rb
kata_2
  |_ instructions.md
  |_ code
    |_ kata_spec.rb
  |_ solution
    |_ kata_spec.rb
```

`instructions.md` is the kata and you can solve the kata in the `code/kata_spec.rb` file.

After you have solved the kata, compare your solution to `solution/kata_spec.rb`!!!

## Ways to approach the katas

> "It is not the destination, but the journey that matters." - Buddha

Solving a kata is the destination but it is not what you should be seeking.
It is the process of solving the kata that gives you the most learning.

Things that you can learn when you are solving the kata:
- Can you try a new way of coding instead of using your "comfortable" method? eg. use classes instead of just methods
- Done something new? Try the kata again to practise it. You will learn more about ideas about your new discovery.
- Add a constraint to the kata to force you to do it differently. (List of coding constraints: http://coderetreat.org/facilitating/activity-catalog)
- Anything that can help you to learn new things.

## Rules

Here's some basic rules that you should follow:
- No searching for the answers (the whole practice will be pointless)
- Don't focus on delivering the code, focus on trying new codings
- Don't do things that you already know (at least not all of them)

## Final word

Enjoy!
