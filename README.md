# README

This is a series of Ruby Katas used for practicing Ruby.

Each kata is grouped in their own folder:

```
kata_1
  |_ instructions.md
  |_ kata_1_spec.rb
kata_2
  |_ instructions.md
  |_ kata_2_spec.rb
```

`instructions.md` is the kata and you can solve the kata in the `kata_1_spec.rb` file.

Enjoy!
